            <h4>A Brief Little Intro...</h4>

            <p>
                I am a web developer that specializes in front end development with experience
                in information architecture.  I have a jack of all trades mentality that caters to a
                broad skill set.  I am an active thinker and like to have as much interaction and involvement
                in the workflow as possible, learning from people with other expertise and sharing
                what insight I can give.
            </p>
            <p>
                I come from a dynamic background, studying economics in school,
                having jobs ranging from being a snowboard instructor, a printer, an SEO analyst, a digital
                marketer, to a developer, I'm always seeking out a challenge that I can live up to.
                I define myself as highly adaptable, and am constantly improving my adaptability through
                my career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I like to stay active to keep some balance.  I am always up for a good hike,
                and try to spend a lot of my weekends riding dirt bikes.  Generally I'm always
                looking for an opportunity to grow and learn and enjoy a good healthy challenge.
            </p>
